% In the US, food products are dated in the following four ways (this dating is voluntary with the exception of baby formula):
%   1.  "Sell-by" - tells the store how long to display the product for sale.
%   2.  "Best if Used By" - recommended for best flavor or quality. It is not a purchase or safety date.
%   3.  "Use By" - the last date recommended for use of the product while at peak quality. The manufacturer of the product has determined the date.
%   4.  "Exp. (Expires)" - this is a true expiration date. The food is not safe to eat and must be thrown away.

% In an effort to reduce food waste, this knowledge base has been provided to allow users to more accurately determine when products may still be safe 
% to eat even if the date on the product has passed.
